		<li><strong>Personal background:</strong> I was born in New York but my family moved to Charlotte when I was 3 after my sister was born. I have 4 dogs who are all rescues, a cat, a hamster and a turtle.</li>
		<li><strong>Professional background:</strong>  i I worked with Marshall's as a part-time employee for about a year until I was promoted to the womens department coordinator. I worked there for about two more years until I became a shift lead at a pizza restaurant. I still work there part-time while I'm in school.</li>
		<li><strong>Academic background:</strong> I graduated high school in 2013 and started taking college classes the next year. i took two years of classes and then had to put my education on hold so I could focus on working for a while. This is my first year back at school since then so I'm very excited to learn.</li>
		<li><strong>Background in the subject matter of this course:</strong> My dad works as an architect for NTT Data so I'm a little familiar with the subject matter of this course. He always wanted me to purse a career in IT so he has offered some of his knowledge growing up.</li>
		<li><strong>Primary computer platform:</strong> Windows 10</li>
		<li><strong>Reason for taking each course:</strong>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>WEB 115-85:</strong> required for my certificate program. <a href="contract.html">Jump to course contract</a></li>
				<li><strong>WEB 120-85:</strong> required for my certificate program.</li>
			</ul>
		<li><strong>Funny story or interesting item about yourself to remember you by:</strong> My last name was legally changed from Maschiarelli to Massi about a year after I was born because no one could pronounce or spell it.
		<li><strong>I'd also like to share:</strong> I also have a side job as a makeup artist. I mostly do makeup for weddings and events.</ul>
