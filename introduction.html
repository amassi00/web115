			<li><strong>Professional background:</strong>  i I worked with Marshall's as a part-time employee for about a year until I was promoted to the womens department coordinator. I worked there for about two more years until I became a shift lead at a pizza restaurant. I still work there part-time while I'm in school.</li>
			<li><strong>Academic background:</strong> I graduated high school in 2013 and started taking college classes the next year. i took two years of classes and then had to put my education on hold so I could focus on working for a while. This is my first year back at school since then so I'm very excited to learn.</li>
